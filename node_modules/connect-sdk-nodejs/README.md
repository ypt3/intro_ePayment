# Ingenico Connect JavaScript Server2Server

## Introduction

The JavaScript SDK helps you to communicate with the [Ingenico Connect](http://www.ingenico.com/epayments) Server API. It's primary features are:

* convenient JavaScript wrapper around the API calls,
* authentication of all calls
* logging support by proxying log calls to a custom user defined logger instance
* validation of input and
* a logfile obfuscater

See the [Ingenico ePayments Developer Hub](https://developer.globalcollect.com/documentation/api/server/) for more information on how to use the API.
